hello-world
===========

My first Git Hub Repo.

This is the README file for my first git-hub repo called hello-world.

TODO:

First Verify auto closing an issue. 
Then try cloneing the hellow-world repo to local for edits and then committing back to github
Then create a new repo called php-site
Create a single index.php file in the git repo and echo something to a page. 
Then try and deploy that GIT hub repo in Elastic Beanstalk or possibly consider OpsWorks
